                                          DOCUMENTATION FOR PROJECT


We see many designers and collections every season across the world. Rarely do we come across a collection and design point of view that instantly clicks with our sensibility and priorities, like it happened with Document.

Founded in 2014 by Jongsoo Lee, Document is a Seoul-based independent maker focusing on a limited color palette of garments using natural materials of fine quality.

Lee's design viewpoint is characterized by the limitation of color, materials and through what he calls "the repetition of subtle differences." Document sources high quality materials, often from Italy or Japan, and transforms them in well-cut garments in simple color suggestions, with the aim of revealing the individual personality underneath the clothes.
